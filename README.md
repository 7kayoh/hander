# Hander
Simple and open sourced hand-to utility, for your roleplay game's needs.

## Warning!
This project is still under construction, expect unfinished feature and poorly formatted code!

## What's not done

- List fetching
- Actual design for the interface
- Basically the UI
- Yep, it's the UI
- Not even functional yet
- Just a prototype, for now.

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "Hander.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `Hander.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
